# Executive Summary

This is a **sample document** to test the markdown-to-docx converter. It demonstrates all the supported formatting elements.

## Background

The converter supports *italic text*, **bold text**, and ***bold italic text***. It also handles `inline code` formatting and [hyperlinks](https://example.com).

### Key Findings

Here are the main findings from our assessment:

- First bullet point with some detail about the finding
- Second bullet point covering another area
  - Sub-bullet with additional context
  - Another sub-bullet
- Third bullet point wrapping up the section

### Data Summary

| Site | System Size | Annual Savings | Payback |
|------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Morwell | 99.9 kW | $28,400 | 4.2 yrs |
| Osborne | 150 kW | $42,100 | 3.8 yrs |
| Yarraville | 75 kW | $19,800 | 5.1 yrs |

## Methodology

Our approach followed a structured process:

1. Initial site assessment and data collection
2. Energy consumption analysis
3. System design and modelling
   a. Solar yield estimation
   b. Financial modelling
4. Report preparation and peer review

> **Note:** All financial projections are based on current electricity tariffs and may vary based on future rate changes.

## Technical Details

The system configuration uses the following parameters:

```
Panel: LONGi Hi-MO 6 Explorer (580W)
Inverter: Huawei SUN2000-100KTL
Mounting: Clenergy PV-ezRack SolarRoof
```

## Next Steps

1. Client review and feedback
2. Detailed design phase
3. Procurement and installation scheduling
